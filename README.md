# gRPC Sample
**Example how to work with gRPC using different programming languages.**

-------------------------------------

This example shows how to work with gRPC using various programming language. gRPC Server is provided by an ASP.NET Core backend. Each client shows then how to connect and interact with this server.

Examples consider all available communication patters of gRPC:

* Server streaming RPCs
* Client streaming RPCs
* Bidirectional streaming RPCs
